# Daily Scrums

Participants: Sage Johnson, Victoria Lassner, Owen Pick, Dawson Cummings, Alex Anguiano

Notes...

Need to research datetime to solve month offset issue. Templates created by Owen, as well as routes and some models work. Models were created by Sage and Alex. Owen will work on event creation functionality. Sage and the rest of the team will work on implementing US#3 and US#4. US#1 is complete, however US#2 may need some extra polishing.

Notes...

We are all working on US#1, US#2, and US#3, and will start on US#4 after completion of the first 3. We will need to start creating the README_TEMPLATE page. Short and sweet, but that just means we're all hard at work!

Notes...

Owen -- worked on python file to test/simulate times. Changed current time to simulated time. Added 'edit task' page, needs a little more work.

Sage -- Worked on month.html, week.html, day.html, some work on routes, will continue where Owen left off as far as rendering tasks AND events, now that the backbone has been created.

Victoria -- Helped Sage yesterday with above work, will continue pair programming

Alex -- fixed 401 error, pulled latest dev, merging everything together.

day page will need work when rendering tasks, look at new route on lines 29-40 on owen's branch.

Models update - work on rendering week and day html files - edit_task() function -- all between now and tomorrow!

Sprint will be finished on Sunday the 5th. Will do sprint review and retrospective, then Sprint 2 will be planned (and will end on Friday the 10th).

# Sprint Review

Date/Time: 05/05/2024 -- 6:13pm

Participants: Sage Johnson, Alex Anguiano, Owen Pick, Victoria Lassner, Dawson Cummings

Notes...

We all agree that Sprint 1 went well. We didn't complete US#5 completely, but we are on the way towards doing so. We will incorporate the new models.py that Alex has been working on, which includes polymorphism. This should allow us to render the templates more easily, as well as add a better structure of data. We will plan sprint 2 immediately after this and the retrospective.

# Sprint Retrospective

Date/Time: 05/05/2024 -- 6:16pm

Participants: Sage Johnson, Alex Anguiano, Owen Pick, Victoria Lassner, Dawson Cummings

Notes...

We are doing better with communication. We are posting regularly with changes to the project. We have avoided working on the same thing at once by using good comms, as well as pair programming. Coordination is a lot better. Scrum meetings have proven to be very helpful.
