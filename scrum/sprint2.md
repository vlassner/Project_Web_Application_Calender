# Sprint Planning

Date/Time: 05/05/2024 -- 6:20pm

Participants: Owen Pick, Sage Johnson, Alex Anguiano, Victoria Lassner, Dawson Cummings

Goal Statement:  Incorporate new polymorphic models and make them work with the rest of the templates and routes. After that, we will fully implement US#5 and US#6. We will need to create one whitebox and one blackbox test for the project. Near the end of the project, we will also attempt to migrate from SQLite to Postgres, and subsequently compose a Docker compose file.
